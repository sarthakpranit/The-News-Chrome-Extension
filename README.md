## TheNews Chrome Extension

**This is a Google Chrome extension to provide a collated view of Designer News, Product Hunt and Hacker News everytime you open a new tab**

**Why have these pages loaded in your new tab?***
For any designer, it has become increasingly important to stay in sync with latest improvements in the world. Since the definition of design has been getting clearer with every day, I feel it's important to have such updates at the reach of a Cmd+T.

Disclaimer - This website already existed at www.thenews.im. It just seemed like designer would love to have an easy access to such a page.
