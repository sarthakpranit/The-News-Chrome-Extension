## The News Chrome Extension

**This is a Google Chrome extension to provide a collated view of Designer News, Product Hunt and Hacker News everytime you open a new tab**

**Why have these pages loaded in your new tab?***
For any designer, it has become increasingly important to stay in sync with latest improvements in the domain. Since Product Hunt, Designer News and Hacker News have been at the forefront of such news aggregation, I feel it's important to have such updates at a pretty easy reach.
